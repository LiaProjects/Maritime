Periodic instruments recalibration
It is recommended that, unless it is specified by the fiscal authorities or by the Classification Society, Buyer and Seller
agree on the periodicity of recalibration intervals, e.g. at each dry-docking.
TMSA KPI 6.2.2 requires that comprehensive procedures cover all aspects of cargo transfer operations for each type
of vessel within the fleet. The transfer procedures are specific to the vessel type and cargo to be carried. These may
include:
• Pre-arrival checks.
• Cargo survey and sampling.
• Gas and chemical specific operational procedures.
