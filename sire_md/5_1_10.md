### **Question**
Were the Master and officers familiar with the shipboard emergency plan for loss
of propulsion, and had drills taken place to test the effectiveness of the shipboard
emergency response plan in accordance with company procedures?

---

### **Vessel Types**
Oil, Chemical, LPG, LNG

### **ROVIQ Sequence**

shipboard emergencies.

### **Objective**
To ensure that the crew will respond effectively to a loss of propulsion in accordance with the vessel’s
shipboard emergency response plan.

---

### **Suggested Inspector Actions**
• Sight, and where necessary review, the shipboard emergency response plan for a loss of propulsion.
• Review the records of completed loss of propulsion emergency response drills and verify that:
o The latest drill had been completed within the timeframe defined by the drill schedule.
o The details of the drill had been recorded in the defined format required by the company procedure.
o The date and time of the latest drill was consistent with the vessel’s activities as recorded within the
Bridge Log Book.
• Interview one navigation officer and verify that they were familiar with a method for estimating the predicted
drift of a disabled tanker, taking into account the wind, current and ship’s head.

• Interview one engineer officer and verify that they were familiar with the loss of propulsion emergency
response plan.

---

### **Expected Evidence**
• The shipboard emergency response plan for the loss of propulsion.
• The records for completed loss of propulsion emergency response drills.
• The vessel’s Bridge Log Book for the previous twelve months.
• Where a drill had been deferred due to poor weather or sea conditions, communications with the company
relating to the postponement.

---

### **Potential Grounds for a Negative Observation**
• There was no shipboard emergency plan for the loss of propulsion.
• The shipboard emergency plan was insufficiently ship-specific.
• The accompanying officer was unfamiliar with the shipboard emergency plan for the loss of propulsion.
• An interviewed navigation officer was unfamiliar with the process for estimating the predicted drift of a
disabled tanker, taking into account the wind, current and ship’s head.
• An interviewed engineer officer was unfamiliar with the location and content of the vessel’s loss of
propulsion emergency response plan.
• The drill records were not maintained in the format defined by the company procedure.
• The drill scenario was unrealistic or inadequate to test the shipboard emergency plan.
• Drill dates were inconsistent with the vessel activities as recorded within the Bridge Log Book.
• The emergency response drill for a loss of propulsion required by the company onboard emergency
response procedure was overdue or had not been completed in accordance with the defined drill schedule.
• Where a drill had been deferred due to poor weather or sea conditions and the vessel had notified the
company, record as a comment within the Process response tool.
