### **Objective**
To ensure the hull is protected against the risk of brittle fracture in the event of a failure of the cargo
containment or insulation.

---

### **Suggested Inspector Actions**
• Sight, and where necessary review, the company procedures for monitoring the integrity of the containment
system and protecting the hull structure from low temperature exposure.
• Review the records of:
o Inner hull temperature readings.
o Visual inspections of the inner hull structure for cold spots.
o Cold spots identified and actions taken.
• Verify that the inner hull temperature monitoring system is in satisfactory condition and alarms are correctly
set.
• Where fitted, verify that the cofferdam heating system is in satisfactory condition.

• Interview the accompanying officer to verify their familiarity with the:
o Operation, alarm settings and maintenance of the inner hull temperature monitoring equipment.
o Operation and maintenance of the cofferdam heating equipment, where fitted.
o Actions to be taken if:
 A cold spot is detected.
 Cofferdam temperatures fall below 5°C or other stated temperature.
 There is a failure of the cofferdam heating system.

---

### **Expected Evidence**
• Company procedures for monitoring the integrity of the containment system and protecting the hull structure
from low temperature exposure.
• Records of:
o Inner hull temperature readings
o Visual inspections of the inner hull structure for cold spots.
o Cold spots identified and actions taken.

---

### **Potential Grounds for a Negative Observation**
• There were no company procedures for monitoring the integrity of the containment system and protecting
the hull structure from low temperature exposure that included:
o Roles and responsibilities.
o Guidance on the detection of cold spots by the inner hull temperature measurement system, and/or
by visual inspection.
o Operation, alarm settings and maintenance of the inner hull temperature monitoring equipment.
o Operation and maintenance of the cofferdam heating equipment, where fitted.
o Actions to be taken if:
 A cold spot is detected.
 Cofferdam temperatures falls below 5°C or other stated temperature.
 There is a failure of the cofferdam heating system.
o Records to be maintained of:
 Inner hull temperature readings
 Visual inspections of the inner hull structure for cold spots.
 Cold spots identified and actions taken.
• The accompanying officer was not familiar with the:
o Operation, alarm settings and maintenance of the inner hull temperature monitoring equipment.
o Operation and maintenance of the cofferdam heating equipment, where fitted.
o Actions to be taken if:
 A cold spot is detected.
 Cofferdam temperatures fall below 5°C or other stated temperature.
 There is a failure of the cofferdam heating system.
• There were no records of:
o Inner hull temperature readings
o Visual inspections of the inner hull structure for cold spots.
o Cold spots identified and actions taken.
• The inner hull temperature measurement system was defective in any respect.
• The alarms on the inner hull temperature measurement system were not set as required by company
procedures or inhibited.
• The cofferdam heating system was defective in any respect.
• The temperature in the cofferdam(s) had not been maintained as required by company procedures.
