### **Suggested Inspector Actions**
• Sight, and where necessary review, the shipboard emergency response plan for a collision situation.

Bridge Log Book.

### **Expected Evidence**
• The shipboard emergency response plan for a collision situation.
• The records for completed collision emergency response drills.

relating to the deferment.

### **Potential Grounds for a Negative Observation**
• There was no shipboard emergency plan developed for a collision situation.
• The shipboard emergency plan was insufficiently ship-specific.
• The accompanying officer was unfamiliar with the shipboard emergency plan for a collision situation.
• The drill scenario was unrealistic or inadequate to test the shipboard emergency plan.
• Drill dates were inconsistent with the vessel activities as recorded within the Bridge Log Book.
