### **Objective**


---

### **Suggested Inspector Actions**
Review the vessel inspection reports completed by Marine and Technical Superintendents and verify that:
• Vessel inspection reports were available onboard for each of the declared qualifying vessel inspections
completed during the previous eighteen months.
• Each vessel inspection report recorded the observed condition of all operational and accessible areas of the
vessel and its equipment.
• Where areas for improvement or defects were identified, the defect or non-conformity reporting system was
utilised to track the corrective actions through to closure.
• Any remote inspections had been performed as required by the company procedure.

---

### **Expected Evidence**
• Qualifying vessel inspection reports completed by company Marine or Technical Superintendents during the
previous eighteen months.
• Evidence that defects and areas for improvement had been followed up through the company defect
reporting or non-conformity reporting systems.
• The company procedure for conducting remote inspections, if applicable.

---

### **Potential Grounds for a Negative Observation**
• Reports were not available onboard for each declared qualifying vessel inspection conducted by a company
Marine or Technical Superintendent.

• The inspection report format did not cover all operational and accessible areas of the vessel and its
equipment.
• The interval between successive qualifying inspections by either a Marine or Technical Superintendent
exceeded seven months.
• It was more than fourteen months since either the previous Marine or Technical Superintendent inspection.
• Where the vessel was new to management there had been no Marine or Technical inspection completed
since handover or delivery.
• Remote inspections had been conducted but there was no company procedure which defined:
o The circumstances in which a remote inspection may be used to substitute for a physical
inspection.
o The condition verification processes for all areas of the ship under inspection.
o The required content of the final inspection report.
• More than one remote inspection had been conducted when a physical inspection could reasonably have
been carried out.
• There was no evidence that each area for improvement or defect identified within the vessel inspection
reports had been followed up through the documented company processes either as non-conformities or
defect reports.
