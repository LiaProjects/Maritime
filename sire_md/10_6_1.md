prevention on deck.
• Review the operating instructions for the system posted in the space(s) and verify that the system valves
and controls are properly marked and set.
• Review inspection and servicing data available in the space(s).
• Inspect the system piping, particularly on the underside, for external indications of corrosion and for
patching.
• Examine a random sample of nozzles for evidence of clogging by debris.
• Request an accompanying crew member to randomly check the isolating valves and stop valves to verify
they are operating freely.
• If necessary, review the records of inspections, tests and maintenance carried out contained in the
maintenance plan.
• Interview the accompanying officer to verify their familiarity with the purpose and operation of the water
spray system with reference to:
o Starting the pumps.
