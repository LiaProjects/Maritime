## Question 14.2.1

**Paragraph Number:**
14.2.1

---

### **Question**
This system shall provide sufficient high-pressure air capacity to supply, through pressure-reduction
devices, enough low-pressure air to enable two men to work in a gas-dangerous space for at least 1 h
without using the air bottles of the breathing apparatus. Means shall be provided for recharging the fixed air
bottles and the breathing apparatus air bottles from a special air compressor suitable for the supply of high-
pressure air of the required purity; or
2. an equivalent quantity of spare bottled air in lieu of the low-pressure airline.
14.2.5 At least one set of safety equipment as required by 14.2.2 shall be kept in a suitable clearly marked locker in a
readily accessible place near the cargo pump-room. The other sets of safety equipment shall also be kept in suitable,
clearly marked, easily accessible places.
14.2.6 The breathing apparatus shall be inspected at least once a month by a responsible officer, and the inspection
recorded in the ship’s log-book. The equipment shall be inspected and tested by an expert at least once a year.
Inspection Guidance
An 'expert' in the context of this question may be a member of the crew provided that:
• The crew member who conducted the annual maintenance had attended a manufacturer's training course
for the specific type of SCBA carried on board within the five years prior to the last service.
• The specialist testing equipment required to complete the annual service in accordance with the
manufacturer's instructions was available on board at the time of the annual service.
• A copy of the manufacturer's training course certificate for the member of the crew who conducted the
annual service was retained with the maintenance records.
The vessel operator should have developed procedures relating to the safety equipment, including SCBAs, required
by the IBC Code, giving guidance on:
• Stowage and maintaining readiness of the equipment.
• Inspection and testing of the SCBAs.
• Non-emergency use of the SCBAs, including routine maximum personal daily use and required rest periods.
 – SIRE 2.0 Question Library Part 2 – Version 1.0 (January 2022)
For vessels carrying toxic cargoes, the safety equipment referred to above should provide full protection. The
protective suits themselves shall be capable of providing adequate protection against the product as indicated in the
appropriate resistance table that is provided by the manufacturer, and fitted with integral gloves and boots. The
responsible officer should be aware of these limitations as they relate to the cargoes being carried. Such protective
suits are not required if the vessel does not carry toxic cargoes.
If required to be carried, the protective suits must be suitable for:
• All chemicals listed on the certificate of fitness identified under column ‘o’ in the table of chapter 17 of the
IBC code.
• Use in a flammable atmosphere.
Some of these procedures may form part of the onboard maintenance plan.
This question will only be allocated where HVPQ question 9.33.3 has been answered as yes.
Suggested Inspector Actions
• Sight, and where necessary review, company procedures for the use of the safety equipment, including
SCBAs, required by the IBC Code.
• Review the records of inspection and testing of the SCBAs forming part of the safety equipment required by
the IBC.
• Where the annual testing of the SCBA’s had been completed by an ‘expert’ member of the crew, review:
o The records of the last annual service and verify that a copy of the manufacturer's training course
certificate for the specific type of SCBA carried on board was retained for the crewmember who
performed the service.
o The specialist equipment required by the manufacturer to conduct the annual servicing.
• Inspect at least one set of safety equipment required by the IBC Code.
• Interview the accompanying officer to verify their familiarity with company procedures for the use of the
safety equipment, including SCBAs, required by the IBC Code.
Expected Evidence
• Company procedures for the use of the safety equipment, including SCBAs, required by the IBC Code.
• Records of inspection and testing of the SCBAs forming part of the safety equipment required by the IBC.
• Evidence that the protective suits were suitable for:
o All chemicals listed on the certificate of fitness identified under column ‘o’ in the table of chapter 17
of the IBC code.
o Use in a flammable atmosphere.
• Where annual testing of the SCBAs had been conducted by an 'expert' member of the crew, a copy of the
manufacturer's training course certificate for the specific type of SCBA carried on board for the crewmember
who performed the service.
Potential Grounds for a Negative Observation
• There were no company procedures relating to the safety equipment, including SCBAs, required by the IBC
Code, giving guidance on:
o Stowage and maintaining readiness of the equipment.
o Inspection and testing of the SCBAs.
o Non-emergency use of the SCBAs, including maximum individual daily use and required rest
periods.
• The accompanying officer was not familiar with the company procedures relating to the safety equipment,
including SCBAs, required by the IBC Code.
 – SIRE 2.0 Question Library Part 2 – Version 1.0 (January 2022)
• There were less than three complete sets of safety equipment on board, in addition to those required by
SOLAS regulation II-2/10.10 for fire-fighting purposes.
• A set of safety equipment did not contain:
o one self-contained air-breathing apparatus (not using stored oxygen).
o protective clothing, boots, gloves and tight-fitting goggles.
o fireproof lifeline with belt resistant to the cargoes carried.
o explosion-proof lamp.
• The protective suits where not suitable for:
o All chemicals listed on the certificate of fitness identified under column ‘o’ in the table of chapter 17
of the IBC code.
o Use in a flammable atmosphere.
• For the safety equipment required by the IBC, the vessel was not equipped with either:
o One set of fully charged spare air bottles for each breathing apparatus,
o A special air compressor suitable for the supply of high-pressure air of the required purity,
o A charging manifold capable of dealing with sufficient spare air bottles for the breathing apparatus;
or
o fully charged spare air bottles with a total free air capacity of at least 6,000 l for each breathing
apparatus on board in excess of the requirements of SOLAS regulation II-2/10.10.
• The sets of safety equipment were not stowed:
o Outside hazardous areas.
o In a suitable, clearly marked, easily accessible place.
• The sets of safety equipment were not ready for immediate use because:
o Air cylinders, including spares, were not fully charged.
o Adjusting straps were not kept slack so as to enable the SCBAs to be donned quickly.
o Protective clothing, boots and gloves were not ready to be donned quickly.
• The SCBA required by the IBC had not been:
o Inspected at least once a month by a responsible officer, and the inspection recorded in the ship’s
logbook.
o Inspected and tested by an expert within the last 12 months.
• Where the SCBA required by the IBC code had been tested onboard by an ‘expert’ member of the crew:
o A copy of the manufacturer's training course certificate for the specific type of SCBA carried on
board for the crewmember who performed the service was not available with the maintenance
records.
o The specialist equipment required by the manufacturer to conduct the annual servicing was not
available onboard
