### **Question**
13.3 .7 When arrangements are provided for overriding the overflow control system, they shall be such that
inadvertent operation is prevented. When this override is operated, continuous visual indication shall be given at the
relevant control station(s) and the navigation bridge.
15.1.2 Loading limit (LL) means the maximum allowable liquid volume relative to the tank volume to which the tank
may be loaded.
15.6.1 A document shall be provided to the ship, specifying the maximum allowable loading limits for each cargo tank
and product, at each applicable loading temperature and maximum reference temperature. The information in this
document shall be approved by the Administration or recognised organization acting on its behalf.
15.6.2 Pressures at which the PRVs have been set shall also be stated in the document.
15.6.3 A copy of the above document shall be permanently kept on board by the master.
18.6.2 Essential cargo handling controls and alarms shall be checked and tested prior to cargo transfer operations.

Chapter II-2 Regulation 11
 – SIRE 2.0 Question Library Part 2 – Version 1.0 (January 2022)
6.3.1 Preventive measures against liquid rising in the venting system
Provisions shall be made to guard against liquid rising in the venting system to a height which would exceed the
design head of cargo tanks. This shall be accomplished by high-level alarms or overflow control systems or other
equivalent means, together with independent gauging devices and cargo tank filling procedures. For the purposes of
this regulation, spill valves are not considered equivalent to an overflow system.
Inspection Guidance
This question relates only to those alarm systems that are independent of the tank gauging system, and for the
purposes of this question, “overfill alarms” means those alarm systems variously described as:
• Overflow alarms.
• Overflow control systems.
• Automatic shut off systems.
• Automatic shutdown systems.
• High-high level alarms
• Extra-high-level alarms.
The vessel operator should have developed procedures for the maintenance, setting and testing of the cargo tank
high-level and overfill alarm systems, including:
• The mandatory use of the alarms during all cargo tank loading, discharging and transfer operations.
• Set points for all tank level alarms.
• Testing procedures and frequency.
• Records of testing and maintenance to be kept.
• Guidance on the operation of shipboard automatic closing valves.
• Controls on overriding of overfill alarms/automatic shutdown systems.
• Procedures, based on risk assessment, to enable continued cargo loading, discharge or transfer operations
in the event of a failure of the cargo tank high-level or overfill alarm system, or a single alarm for an
individual cargo tank.
The instructions within the manufacturer’s manuals and the vessel’s maintenance plan may form part of the
procedures.
The overfill alarm system should only be overridden in exceptional circumstances, such as if the tank has been
overfilled and it is necessary to bypass the overflow control system to discharge the tank. Such systems are
occasionally overridden at sea during reliquefication and in bad weather conditions.
(See IGC 13.3.4 above for those pressurised vessels where these alarm systems are not required. In older GC
vessels, the overfill alarm sensor does not need to be independent of the high-level sensor)
Suggested Inspector Actions
• Sight, and where necessary review the company procedures for the maintenance, setting and testing of the
cargo tank high-level and overfill alarm systems.
• Sight and where necessary review the document specifying the maximum allowable loading limits for each
cargo tank and product at each applicable loading temperature and maximum reference temperature.
• Review the records of testing and maintenance of the cargo tank high-level and overfill alarm systems.
• Inspect the alarm indicator panels in the cargo control room or position and verify:
o The panel was switched on with all cargo tanks being monitored.
o The audible and visible alarms were operational.
• Inspect the alarm equipment on deck including the audible and visible alarm fittings, where fitted.
 – SIRE 2.0 Question Library Part 2 – Version 1.0 (January 2022)
• Interview the accompanying officer to verify their familiarity with:
o The company procedures for the maintenance, setting and testing of the cargo tank high-level and
overfill alarm systems.
o The circumstances under which the cargo tank high-level and overfill alarm systems or individual
tanks alarms may be isolated and the safeguards to ensure they were always in operation during
cargo transfer operations.
Expected Evidence
• The company procedures for the maintenance, setting and testing of the cargo tank high-level and overfill
alarm systems.
• Records of the maintenance, testing and setting of the cargo tank high-level and overfill alarm systems.
• The document specifying the maximum allowable loading limits for each cargo tank and product, at each
applicable loading temperature and maximum reference temperature.
Potential Grounds for a Negative Observation
• There were no company procedures for the maintenance, testing and setting of the cargo tank high-level
and overfill alarm systems.
• The company procedures for the maintenance, testing and setting of the cargo tank high-level and overfill
alarm systems did not include:
o The mandatory use of the alarms during all loading, discharging and transfer operations.
o Set points for all alarms.
o Testing procedures and frequency.
o Records of testing and maintenance to be kept.
o Guidance on the operation of shipboard automatic closing valves.
o Controls on overriding of overfill alarms/automatic shutdown systems.
o Procedure, based on risk assessment, to enable continued cargo loading, discharge or transfer
operations in the event of a failure of the cargo tank high-level or overfill alarm system or a single
alarm for an individual cargo tank.
• The accompanying officer was not familiar with:
o The company procedures for the maintenance, testing and setting of the cargo tank high-level and
overfill alarm systems.
o The circumstances under which the cargo tank high-level and overfill alarm systems or individual
cargo tank alarms may be overridden and the safeguards to ensure they were always in operation
during cargo transfer operations.
• There were no records of testing and maintenance of the cargo tank high-level and overfill alarm systems,
including tests:
o Prior to cargo operations.
o After dry-docking or decommissioning.
• High-level and/or overfill alarms had not been regularly tested in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• The document specifying the maximum allowable loading limits for each cargo tank and product, at each
applicable loading temperature and maximum reference temperature was not available on board.
• Overfill alarms were set above the applicable maximum allowable loading limit for a cargo tank.
• High-level and/or overfill alarms were not set at the level required by company procedures.
• High-level and/or overfill alarms were not in operation at the time of inspection, during loading, discharging
or transfer operations.
• The high-level or overfill alarm system had been overridden during cargo transfer operations.
• The high-level or overfill alarm system was defective in any respect.
